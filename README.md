## üìÅ Files Overview

### üìå Pine Scripts

#### 1. `2bulls_rsi.pine`
A custom RSI-based indicator possibly developed by "2bulls." Likely includes modifications to the traditional RSI logic for better signal generation.

#### 2. `5_20ema-strategy.pine`
A crossover strategy based on the 5 EMA and 20 EMA. This script is used to generate buy/sell signals when the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA.

#### 3. `ema_gap.pine.txt`
This script likely identifies the price gap between two EMAs and may be used to detect overbought/oversold conditions or trend strength.

#### 4. `options.pine.txt`
A TradingView script designed for options trading. It may visualize options levels such as support/resistance based on OI, volume, or max pain theory.

#### 5. `trendline.pine`
An automated trendline detection tool. This script draws dynamic support/resistance or trendlines based on price action and pivot points.

#### 6. `HTF MACD RSI & SUPERTREND.txt`
A multi-indicator script combining:
- Higher Time Frame (HTF) MACD
- HTF RSI
- Supertend Indicator  
Likely used for confirmation-based entries across multiple timeframes.

#### 7. `mutliple time frame macd and rsi.txt`
Similar to above but might be a simplified or alternate version that plots MACD and RSI from higher timeframes on the current chart.

### üêç Python Script

#### 8. `emacrossover.py`
A Python script for analyzing EMA crossovers using external market data (e.g., via APIs like Upstox, Zerodha Kite, or Yahoo Finance). Useful for automated strategy testing or signal generation outside TradingView.
